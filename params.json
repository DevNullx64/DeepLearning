{"name":"DCatcher's Deep Learning Library","tagline":"Simple and Cutting-edge Deep Learning Library accelerated with GPU using C++ AMP","body":"This project provides the **simplest** deep learning library with GPU acceleration in pure C++11. \r\n\r\n**Unique features of this projects:**\r\n\r\n1. Only one .h/.cpp file for the core logic and model. To keep everything as simple as possible, I only implement the most successful model and training methods. So it's good place for the beginner of deep learning.\r\n\r\n2. Following the latest update in deep learning research. A good place for deep learning veteran to try out your own ideas based on the latest work. \r\n\r\n3. Support GPU acceleration via c++ amp. So it inherits all the advantages of amp:\r\n  *   support AMD, NVIDIA and INTEL video cards as long as your video card supports directx11.\r\n  *   pure c++11 syntax and fully object-oriented, no need for c-style vender-specific kernel, easy to understand.\r\n  *   easy GPU debugging with visual studio\r\n\r\n   With GPU acceleration, you can solve real problem with a single machine.
